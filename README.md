**Malware + Tests** – My Malware Development Learning and Testing Repository  

Welcome to **MalWests**, a repository dedicated to exploring malware development for **educational and research purposes only**.  
Each folder in this repo contains:  
- A **malware code sample** (developed as part of my learning process).  
- A **README** describing the malware's behavior, techniques, and purpose.  
- **Malware scanner results** for analysis and detection insights.  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> All samples are for **educational purposes** and should only be run in **isolated, controlled environments** like sandboxes or virtual machines.  
> I do **not** encourage or condone malicious use.
